    <h1>My HTML Journey</h1>
    <h2>From Novice to Knowledgeable</h2>
    <h3>Key Milestones</h3>

    <p>Starting my journey into the world of website development, I knew next to nothing about HTML and CSS before this class. It was very daunting at first with all of this new information â€” all these tags and styles seemed like a whole new language. But that was exactly it; it <em>was</em> a new language I was excited to learn. My coursework in CS 1030 laid the foundation, teaching me the basics of structuring web pages and styling them to look appealing.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to today, and I've created multiple projects that I'm proud of. From a simple web page detailing trail running tips to a more complex one exploring the intricacies of the CSS box model, each project has been a step up in my coding skills. Not only have I learned how to layout content and style it dynamically, but I've also gained confidence in troubleshooting and refining my code.</p>
